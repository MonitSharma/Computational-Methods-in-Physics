Folder for plots created by .py code:
--------------------------------------------

Filenames indicate the axes of the plot,

i.e. xvx.py is a plot of the relation between position in x-direction, x, and
velocity in x-direction, v_x.

**Figures from Problem 9**

Motion of a single particle in z-direction:

zt.pdf

Motion of two particles with and without particle interactions:
- xy_{duration}.pdf  (in the xy-plane for t = 100 $\mu$s and t = 1000 $\mu s$)
- xyz0_{duration}.pdf (in the xyz-space without interactions)
- xyz1_{duration}.pdf (in the xyz-space with interactions)
- phase_space_{duration}.pdf (plot of position vs velocity in each direction w/ & w/o interactions)

Relative error plots:
- relative_error_EC.pdf   (for Euler-Cromer method)
- relative_error_RK4.pdf (for 4th order Runge-Kutta method)

**Figures from Problem 10 regarding applied angular frequency and the fraction of remaining
particles in the trap when the electric field is not constant**

fraction_vs_angfreq_100avg.pdf

fract_vs_angfreq_zoom.pdf (zoomed in around resonance)
