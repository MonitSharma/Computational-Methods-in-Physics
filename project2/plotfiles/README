# This folder contains the plotfiles of Project 2

plot6.py:
---------
Makes the plot of the relation between the number of Jacobi rotations and the size, N, of
the symmetrical tridiagonal matrix and saves it in the file:

*../figures/rotations_vs_N.pdf*

plot7.py:
------------------
Makes a plot of both the analytical and discretized approximated eigenvectors vs xhat and saves the results
for matrices of sixes N=10 and N=100 in pdf files named:

*../figures/x_vs_eigvecn=10.pdf* 
*../figures/x_vs_eigvecn=100.pdf*
