# Computational-Methods-in-Physics


Folder for files for Computation Physics course at IISERM for 2021. 
Code written in Python and C++. The code for each project is located in their respective folders.


------


## Project 1:

Numerical Solution to the one-dimensional **Poisson Equation** by converting the second derivative to a solvable matrix equation.

$$Av = g$$


----

## Project 2:

Numerical Solution of an eigenvalue problem exemplified by a special case of the one-dimensional buckling beam.




--------

## Project 3: 

Simulation of a Penning trap which confines charged particles using static electric and magnetic fields.



-------

## Project 4:

Simulation of the Ising model in two dimensions to explore temperature-dependent behaviour in ferromagnets and numerically estimate the critical temperature at which the system undergoes a phase transition (from magnetized phase to a phase with no net magnetization).


-------


## Project 5:

Simulation of the two dimensional time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation to study a double-slit-in-a-box setup and variations thereof.
